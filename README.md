SimpleQ is a web app used for teachers to generate study tools for the use of their students. As a admin user the teacher can
create a quiz, to choose between three differnt templates of quizzing. Users are also to add pictures to their quizzes as well, 
add the question they want, and also the answers they want. Students just have to browse to the site find the quiz they want 
to take and attempt it. All results are emailed to the teacher that created that quiz.
